# Listings Test

This demo uses a binary tree to fill a known space with objects of known dimentions. 

This bin sorting algrorithm uses a online modal of sorting, meaning the objects are placed as they come.

The Listing sizes are base 2 for aesthetic reasons, but will work with random sizes as well.
